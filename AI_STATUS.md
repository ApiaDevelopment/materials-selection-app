**Test Query Example:**

```json
POST /ai/docs
{
  "question": "What type of countertops are specified?"
}

Response:
{
  "success": true,
  "response": "The specified countertops for the Sturgeon Residence Kitchen Renovation are made of Quartz composite. The material is characterized by its white color with gray veining and an eased edge profile. The total square footage of the countertops is 45 sq ft. Additionally, there is a matching 4-inch quartz backsplash used for the backsplash area.",
  "citations": [
    {
      "text": "The specified countertops...",
      "sources": [
        {
          "content": "PROJECT SPECIFICATION - KITCHEN REMODEL...",
          "location": "s3://materials-kb-documents-634752426026/test-projects/kitchen-project-spec.txt"
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "sessionId": "ac9efcd9-ead3-4559-8e3d-f6d095204f7b"
}
```

### Phase 2.5: AI Action Buttons ✅ COMPLETE

**Completed:** February 6, 2026  
**Commit:** (Pending) - "Add AI action buttons for product recommendations"

**Problem Solved:**

AI could recommend products but couldn't help users add them to projects. Users had to manually search for the product and create line items themselves.

**Solution:**

Action buttons that appear on AI responses when products are mentioned. Click a button → select category → line item created automatically.

**Features:**

- **Smart Product Detection:** Backend parses AI responses for product mentions
- **Suggested Actions:** Returns structured action data with each response
- **Action Buttons UI:** Displays clickable buttons below AI messages
- **Category Selector:** Modal to choose which category for the line item
- **Success Feedback:** Confirmation messages in chat after successful creation
- **Complete Product Data:** Includes vendor, manufacturer, pricing, quantities

**Technical Implementation:**

**Backend Changes (lambda/index.js):**

- Added `extractProductActions()` function to detect products in AI text
- Loads all products and vendors for matching against AI responses
- Enhanced system prompt to encourage detailed product recommendations
- Returns `suggestedActions` array in API response with:
  - Action type, label, help text
  - Product ID, name, model number
  - Vendor and manufacturer details
  - Pricing and quantity defaults
- Matches on model number (specific) or product name (broader)
- Limits to top 3 suggestions to avoid UI clutter

**Frontend Changes (ChatAssistant.tsx):**

- Added `SuggestedAction` interface for type safety
- Fetches categories on component mount
- Displays action buttons below messages when `suggestedActions` present
- Category selector modal for user to choose destination
- `handleAction()` and `handleCategorySelect()` for button interactions
- Calls existing `POST /categories/{categoryId}/lineitems` endpoint
- Shows success/error feedback as assistant messages

**User Flow Example:**

1. User: "What faucet should I use for this bathroom?"
2. AI: "I recommend the Kohler K-596-VS Simplified..."
3. Button appears: "Add Kohler K-596-VS" with vendor/price info
4. User clicks button
5. Modal shows: "Select Category" with all project categories
6. User selects "Fixtures"
7. Line item created with product, vendor, manufacturer, pricing
8. Chat shows: "✅ Added Kohler K-596-VS to Fixtures"

**Alternative to Bedrock Agents:**

This provides mutation capabilities (creating data) without the complexity of Phase 3 Agents. Users get explicit control via button clicks instead of natural language commands like "add that to fixtures." Can upgrade to full agents later if valuable.

## Current AI Capabilities

### ✅ What It HAS

1. **In-session conversational memory** (Project Chat mode)
   - Remembers context within a single chat session
   - Conversation history maintained while chat window is open
   - Each request includes full message history

2. **Session IDs** from Knowledge Base
   - Each document search returns a sessionId
   - Currently not being used for follow-up queries

3. **Semantic search** over documents
   - Not limited to exact keyword matching
   - Understands concepts and synonyms
   - Returns relevant passages with citations

4. **Full project context awareness**
   - Loads all related data from DynamoDB
   - Understands relationships between entities
   - Can answer complex queries about project state

5. **AI-suggested actions with one-click execution** (NEW Feb 6)
   - Detects product recommendations in AI responses
   - Displays action buttons to add products to project
   - Category selector for choosing destination
   - Creates line items automatically with full product data

### ❌ What It DOES NOT Have (Learning)

1. **No persistent conversation history**
   - Conversations aren't saved to a database
   - No conversation history table in DynamoDB
   - Each chat session starts fresh

2. **No cross-session memory**
   - If you close the chat and reopen, it forgets everything
   - No "remember last conversation" feature
   - Can't reference what you discussed yesterday

3. **No learning from feedback**
   - No thumbs up/down buttons
   - No tracking of which answers were helpful
   - No prompt adjustment based on usage patterns

4. **No automatic Knowledge Base updates**
   - Documents must be manually uploaded to S3
   - Must manually sync Knowledge Base after changes
   - No automatic re-indexing when SharePoint files change

5. **No model fine-tuning**
   - Not training the AI on your specific data
   - Using pre-trained Amazon Nova Micro as-is
   - No custom model weights or parameters

## How to Demo Tomorrow

### Opening the Chat

1. Navigate to https://mpmaterials.apiaconsulting.com
2. Open any project (e.g., "SP Test 1")
3. Click the blue chat bubble (💬) in the bottom-right corner

### Demo Project Chat Mode

Show how it understands project data from DynamoDB:

- "What's the total budget for this project?"
- "Which vendors are we using?"
- "Show me all the line items"
- "What categories do we have?"
- Follow-up: "And what's the allowance for each?"

### Demo Document Search Mode

1. Click "Documents" tab in the chat header
2. Show semantic search with citations:
   - "What type of countertops are specified?"
   - "What appliances are needed?"
   - "Tell me about the flooring"
   - "What's the project budget?" (shows it finds $1,000 from document)

### Show Citations

- Point out the "Sources:" section in document answers
- Show the filename: kitchen-project-spec.txt
- Explain this proves the AI is using actual documents

### Demo Action Buttons (NEW - Feb 6)

1. Stay in Project Chat mode
2. Ask: "What faucet should I use for the bathroom?"
3. AI will recommend a specific product (e.g., Kohler model)
4. **Action button appears** below the message: "Add [Product Name]"
5. Shows vendor and price in help text
6. Click the button
7. **Category selector modal** appears
8. Select "Fixtures" (or appropriate category)
9. **Success message** appears: "✅ Added [Product] to Fixtures"
10. Navigate to category to verify line item was created
11. Show product details (vendor, manufacturer, pricing all populated)

**Key Points to Highlight:**

- AI detects product mentions automatically
- One-click to add recommended products
- No typing commands like "add that to fixtures"
- Explicit user control (must click button)
- Complete product data flows through

## Known Limitations

1. **Document Search uses test data**
   - Currently only has kitchen-project-spec.txt
   - Need to upload real SharePoint documents

2. **No conversation persistence**
   - Chat history lost when window closes
   - Each session starts fresh

3. **Knowledge Base sessions not used**
   - Document Search doesn't maintain context across questions
   - Each query is independent

4. **No error recovery UI**
   - If AI fails, just shows generic error message
   - Could add retry logic or fallback responses

5. **No rate limiting**
   - Could be expensive if users spam queries
   - Should add throttling/quotas

6. **No authentication**
   - API is open (protected by obscure URL)
   - Should add Cognito or API keys for production

---

## Cost Considerations

**Current Usage:**

- Nova Micro: ~$0.00015 per 1K input tokens, ~$0.00060 per 1K output tokens
- Knowledge Base: Pay per retrieval query
- OpenSearch Serverless: ~$700/month minimum (OCU-based)
  - ⚠️ **This is the biggest cost driver**
  - May want to consider switching to Aurora/Neptune for production

**Optimization Options:**

- Use smaller context windows
- Cache common queries
- Batch document uploads
- Consider vector store alternatives (Aurora Serverless, Neptune)
