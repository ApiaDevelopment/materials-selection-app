{
  "question": "What type of countertops are specified?"
}

Response:
{
  "success": true,
  "response": "The specified countertops for the Sturgeon Residence Kitchen Renovation are made of Quartz composite. The material is characterized by its white color with gray veining and an eased edge profile. The total square footage of the countertops is 45 sq ft. Additionally, there is a matching 4-inch quartz backsplash used for the backsplash area.",

    }
  ],
  "sessionId": "ac9efcd9-ead3-4559-8e3d-f6d095204f7b"
}
```

### Phase 2.5: AI Action Buttons ✅ COMPLETE

**Completed:** February 6, 2026  
**Commit:** (Pending) - "Add AI action buttons for product recommendations"

**Problem Solved:**

AI could recommend products but couldn't help users add them to projects. Users had to manually search for the product and create line items themselves.

**Solution:**

Action buttons that appear on AI responses when products are mentioned. Click a button → select category → line item created automatically.

**Features:**

- **Smart Product Detection:** Backend parses AI responses for product mentions
- **Suggested Actions:** Returns structured action data with each response
- **Action Buttons UI:** Displays clickable buttons below AI messages
- **Category Selector:** Modal to choose which category for the line item
- **Success Feedback:** Confirmation messages in chat after successful creation
- **Complete Product Data:** Includes vendor, manufacturer, pricing, quantities

**Technical Implementation:**

**Backend Changes (lambda/index.js):**

- Added `extractProductActions()` function to detect products in AI text
- Loads all products and vendors for matching against AI responses
- Enhanced system prompt to encourage detailed product recommendations
- Returns `suggestedActions` array in API response with:
  - Action type, label, help text
  - Product ID, name, model number
  - Vendor and manufacturer details
  - Pricing and quantity defaults
- Matches on model number (specific) or product name (broader)
- Limits to top 3 suggestions to avoid UI clutter

**Frontend Changes (ChatAssistant.tsx):**

- Added `SuggestedAction` interface for type safety
- Fetches categories on component mount
- Displays action buttons below messages when `suggestedActions` present
- Category selector modal for user to choose destination
- `handleAction()` and `handleCategorySelect()` for button interactions
- Calls existing `POST /categories/{categoryId}/lineitems` endpoint
- Shows success/error feedback as assistant messages

**User Flow Example:**

1. User: "What faucet should I use for this bathroom?"
2. AI: "I recommend the Kohler K-596-VS Simplified..."
3. Button appears: "Add Kohler K-596-VS" with vendor/price info
4. User clicks button
5. Modal shows: "Select Category" with all project categories
6. User selects "Fixtures"
7. Line item created with product, vendor, manufacturer, pricing
8. Chat shows: "✅ Added Kohler K-596-VS to Fixtures"

**Alternative to Bedrock Agents:**

This provides mutation capabilities (creating data) without the complexity of Phase 3 Agents. Users get explicit control via button clicks instead of natural language commands like "add that to fixtures." Can upgrade to full agents later if valuable.

**Known Issues with Action Buttons (Feb 6 discussion):**

Product detection is inconsistent due to simple substring matching logic. Buttons only appear when AI response contains the exact product name or model number.

**Why it's inconsistent:**

- Logic scans AI response text AFTER AI generates answer
- Matches products by substring: `aiText.includes(product.modelNumber)` or `aiText.includes(product.name)`
- AI must actually SAY the product name/model in its response to trigger button
- Example failure: User asks "Add K-596-VS" → AI says "I'll help you add that faucet" → No button (AI didn't echo model number)
- Example success: User asks "Recommend towel ring" → AI says "I recommend Moen DN8408CH Towel Ring" → Button appears

**Other issues:**

- Suggests products already on the project (no deduplication)
- Only shows first 3 matches (if many products match, some won't show)
- Short product names (≤5 chars) ignored to avoid false matches
- Simple substring can cause false positives ("Ring" matches "Bearing")

**Potential improvements to consider:**

- Filter out products already in project line items
- Parse user question directly for product references (not just AI response)
- Improve system prompt to encourage AI to echo model numbers
- Use word boundaries/regex for better matching
- Increase limit beyond 3 suggestions
- Add deduplication logic

## Current AI Capabilities

### ✅ What It HAS

1. **In-session conversational memory** (Project Chat mode)
   - Remembers context within a single chat session
   - Conversation history maintained while chat window is open
   - Each request includes full message history

2. **Session IDs** from Knowledge Base
   - Each document search returns a sessionId
   - Currently not being used for follow-up queries

3. **Semantic search** over documents
   - Not limited to exact keyword matching
   - Understands concepts and synonyms
   - Returns relevant passages with citations

4. **Full project context awareness**
   - Loads all related data from DynamoDB
   - Understands relationships between entities
   - Can answer complex queries about project state

5. **AI-suggested actions with one-click execution** (NEW Feb 6)
   - Detects product recommendations in AI responses
   - Displays action buttons to add products to project
   - Category selector for choosing destination
   - Creates line items automatically with full product data

### 🔒 What Data the AI Can See (Project Chat Mode)

**Current project ONLY** - completely isolated:
- Project details (name, customer, address, status, dates, budget)
- Categories for this project only (filtered by projectId)
- Line items for this project only (via ProjectIdIndex)
- Products/Vendors/Manufacturers referenced in THIS project's line items only
- No access to other projects' data
- No access to full product catalog (for chat context)

**Why this matters:**
- Fast performance (indexed queries on single project)
- Privacy - each project's data is isolated
- Predictable context size (500-2000 tokens per project)
- AI can't accidentally reference data from wrong projects

**Product catalog access:**
- ALL products ARE scanned after AI responds (for action button detection only)
- NOT sent to AI as context
- Used only to match product names/model numbers in AI's response text
- Enables action buttons without bloating AI context

**Future enhancement (discussed Feb 6):**
- Cross-project intelligence on-demand (see "Cross-Project Intelligence" in Next Steps)
- Would allow: "Show me similar projects" or "What did we use in other bathrooms?"
- Would still not impact page load times (runs only when explicitly asked)

### ❌ What It DOES NOT Have (Learning)

1. **No persistent conversation history**
   - Conversations aren't saved to a database
   - No conversation history table in DynamoDB
   - Each chat session starts fresh

2. **No cross-session memory**
   - If you close the chat and reopen, it forgets everything
   - No "remember last conversation" feature
   - Can't reference what you discussed yesterday

3. **No learning from feedback**
   - No thumbs up/down buttons
   - No tracking of which answers were helpful
   - No prompt adjustment based on usage patterns

4. **No automatic Knowledge Base updates**
   - Documents must be manually uploaded to S3
   - Must manually sync Knowledge Base after changes
   - No automatic re-indexing when SharePoint files change

5. **No model fine-tuning**
   - Not training the AI on your specific data
   - Using pre-trained Amazon Nova Micro as-is
   - No custom model weights or parameters

## How to Demo Tomorrow

### Opening the Chat

1. Navigate to https://mpmaterials.apiaconsulting.com
2. Open any project (e.g., "SP Test 1")
3. Click the blue chat bubble (💬) in the bottom-right corner

### Demo Project Chat Mode

Show how it understands project data from DynamoDB:

- "What's the total budget for this project?"
- "Which vendors are we using?"
- "Show me all the line items"
- "What categories do we have?"
- Follow-up: "And what's the allowance for each?"

### Demo Document Search Mode

1. Click "Documents" tab in the chat header
2. Show semantic search with citations:
   - "What type of countertops are specified?"
   - "What appliances are needed?"
   - "Tell me about the flooring"
   - "What's the project budget?" (shows it finds $1,000 from document)

### Show Citations

- Point out the "Sources:" section in document answers
- Show the filename: kitchen-project-spec.txt
- Explain this proves the AI is using actual documents

### Demo Action Buttons (NEW - Feb 6)

1. Stay in Project Chat mode
2. Ask: "What faucet should I use for the bathroom?"
3. AI will recommend a specific product (e.g., Kohler model)
4. **Action button appears** below the message: "Add [Product Name]"
5. Shows vendor and price in help text
6. Click the button
7. **Category selector modal** appears
8. Select "Fixtures" (or appropriate category)
9. **Success message** appears: "✅ Added [Product] to Fixtures"
10. Navigate to category to verify line item was created
11. Show product details (vendor, manufacturer, pricing all populated)

**Key Points to Highlight:**

- AI detects product mentions automatically
- One-click to add recommended products
- No typing commands like "add that to fixtures"
- Explicit user control (must click button)
- Complete product data flows through

## Next Steps (Prioritized)

### Immediate (If Demo Goes Well)

**Option 1: Add Conversation Persistence** ⭐ RECOMMENDED FIRST

- Create DynamoDB table: MaterialsSelection-ChatHistory
- Save conversations per project
- Load previous conversations when reopening chat
- Allow users to review past interactions
- Estimated effort: 2-3 hours

**Option 2: Use Knowledge Base Sessions**

- Pass sessionId for follow-up questions in Document Search mode
- Build context across multiple document queries
- Enable conversational document search
- Estimated effort: 1 hour

**Option 3: Add Real Project Documents**

- Export SharePoint files for actual projects
- Upload to S3 bucket (materials-kb-documents-634752426026)
- Re-sync Knowledge Base
- Test queries on real project data
- Estimated effort: 2-4 hours (depends on document count)

### Medium-Term (Next 1-2 Weeks)

**Phase 3: Bedrock Agents** (from AI_INTEGRATION_PLAN.md)

- Autonomous task execution
- Action groups for mutations (create/update data)
- Multi-step reasoning
- Tool calling capabilities
- Estimated effort: 1 week

**Add Feedback Collection**

- Automatic upload to S3
- Automatic Knowledge Base re-sync
- Keep documents up-to-date
- Estimated effort: 1 day

**Cross-Project Intelligence** 🆕 DISCUSSED FEB 6

- Enable AI to recommend based on similar projects
- Use case: "Look at similar bathroom projects and suggest categories/products"
- **NO impact on page load times** - runs on-demand when user asks
- Architecture options:
  - Simple filter-based: Query by project type + budget range (2-3 hours)
  - Semantic search: Index project summaries in OpenSearch (1 day)
  - Hybrid: Filter first, then semantic ranking (best performance)
- Example flow:
  1. User asks: "What categories do similar projects have?"
  2. Backend finds 5-7 projects matching type/budget
  3. Analyzes their categories and popular products
  4. AI responds: "Based on 7 similar bathroom remodels: 100% had Fixtures, 85% had Tile..."
  5. Action buttons appear for recommended products from those projects
- Benefits:
  - Learn from past successful projects
  - Standardize category structures across similar work
  - Discover products that worked well in comparable scenarios
  - No manual searching through old projects
- Performance: Fast (200-500ms query), targeted context (3-5 projects only), stays under token limits
- Estimated effort: 2-4 hours for basic implementation, 1 day for semantic search version

### Long-Term (Future Enhancements)

## Known Limitations

1. **Document Search uses test data**
   - Currently only has kitchen-project-spec.txt
   - Need to upload real SharePoint documents

2. **No conversation persistence**
   - Chat history lost when window closes
   - Each session starts fresh

3. **Knowledge Base sessions not used**
   - Document Search doesn't maintain context across questions
   - Each query is independent

4. **No error recovery UI**
   - If AI fails, just shows generic error message
   - Could add retry logic or fallback responses

5. **No rate limiting**
   - Could be expensive if users spam queries
   - Should add throttling/quotas

6. **No authentication**
   - API is open (protected by obscure URL)
   - Should add Cognito or API keys for production

---

## Cost Considerations

**Current Usage:**

- Nova Micro: ~$0.00015 per 1K input tokens, ~$0.00060 per 1K output tokens
- Knowledge Base: Pay per retrieval query (~$0.01 per query)
- OpenSearch Serverless: **~$0.30/month** (usage-based, standby replicas disabled)
  - ✅ **Bedrock-managed collections are cost-optimized**
  - Self-managed OSS would cost ~$700/month with high-availability
  - Current actual cost: <$0.01/day based on Feb 1-6 billing
  - Scales with data volume, not fixed OCU allocation

**Why It's So Cheap:**

Bedrock automatically creates OpenSearch Serverless collections with `standbyReplicas: DISABLED`, which eliminates the 4-OCU minimum that drives costs to $700/month. Instead, it uses usage-based pricing optimized for small datasets.

**Optimization Options:**

- Use smaller context windows
- Cache common queries
- Batch document uploads
- Monitor costs as data volume increases
