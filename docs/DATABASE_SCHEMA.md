# DynamoDB Database Schema - Materials Selection App

## Table Status Overview

### ✅ ACTIVE TABLES (Currently Used - Hyphen Format)

These tables use **hyphens** (`MaterialsSelection-TableName`) and are actively used by the application:

1. **MaterialsSelection-Projects**
2. **MaterialsSelection-Categories**
3. **MaterialsSelection-LineItems**
4. **MaterialsSelection-Vendors**
5. **MaterialsSelection-Manufacturers**
6. **MaterialsSelection-Products**
7. **MaterialsSelection-Orders**
8. **MaterialsSelection-OrderItems**
9. **MaterialsSelection-Receipts**
10. **MaterialsSelection-ProductVendors**

### ❌ OBSOLETE TABLES (Can Be Deleted - Underscore Format)

These tables use **underscores** (`MaterialsSelection_TableName`) and are **NOT used** by the application. They are likely from early development iterations.

1. ❌ **MaterialsSelection_Projects** - DUPLICATE, can delete
2. ❌ **MaterialsSelection_Categories** - DUPLICATE, can delete
3. ❌ **MaterialsSelection_LineItems** - DUPLICATE, can delete
4. ❌ **MaterialsSelection_Vendors** - DUPLICATE, can delete
5. ❌ **MaterialsSelection_Manufacturers** - DUPLICATE, can delete
6. ❌ **MaterialsSelection_Products** - DUPLICATE, can delete

**Safe to Delete:** All underscore tables can be safely deleted without affecting the application.

  "updatedAt": "2025-01-15T10:00:00Z"
}
```

**Business Logic:**

- Same product can have different costs at different vendors
- When product selected in UI, system queries this table to get vendor options and prices
- Only one vendor per product can have `isPrimary: true`

  "orderedQuantity": 2,
  "orderedPrice": 245.0,
  "createdAt": "2025-01-20T09:00:00Z"
}
```

**Business Logic:**

- One line item can appear in multiple orders (split orders, reorders)
- Tracks historical pricing (orderedPrice may differ from current LineItem.unitCost)

  "receivedQuantity": 2,
  "notes": "All items in good condition",
  "createdAt": "2025-01-25T14:30:00Z"
}
```

**Business Logic:**

- Multiple receipts can exist for one order item (partial deliveries)
- Updates line item status to "received" when quantities match
- Tracks receiving history for auditing

### Key Relationships Explained

**Project → Category → LineItem**

- Hierarchical structure for organizing materials
- Project has categories, categories have line items

**LineItem → Product → ProductVendor → Vendor**

- Line item optionally references a product from the catalog
- Product can be sold by multiple vendors at different prices
- ProductVendors junction table holds vendor-specific pricing

**LineItem → OrderItem → Order → Vendor**

- Order workflow: Create order → Add line items to order → Place order with vendor
- OrderItem links line items to specific orders
- Tracks historical pricing and quantities

**OrderItem → Receipt**

- Receiving workflow: Order arrives → Create receipt records
- Supports partial deliveries (multiple receipts per order item)

## Typical Data Flow Example

### Scenario: Adding a bathroom sink to a project

1. **Create Line Item**

   ```
   Project: "Vance Bathroom Remodel"
   Category: "Plumbing"
   LineItem: "Undermount Sink"
     → Select Product: "K-2209-0" (Kohler)
     → Auto-populate manufacturer: Kohler
     → System queries ProductVendors for K-2209-0
     → Shows Ferguson ($245), Home Depot ($230)
     → Select Ferguson (primary vendor)
     → Line item created with all references
   ```

2. **Create Order**

   ```
   Vendor: Ferguson
   Order: PO-2025-001
   OrderItem: Links to "Undermount Sink" line item
     → orderedQuantity: 2
     → orderedPrice: $245 (locked in at time of order)
   ```

3. **Receive Items**
   ```
   OrderItem: "Undermount Sink" from PO-2025-001
   Receipt:
     → receivedDate: 2025-01-25
     → receivedQuantity: 2
     → Line item status updated to "received"
   ```

## DynamoDB Access Patterns

### Common Query Patterns

1. **Get all categories for a project**
   - Use: CategoryIdIndex GSI
   - Query: `projectId = ?`

2. **Get all line items for a category**
   - Use: CategoryIdIndex GSI
   - Query: `categoryId = ?`

3. **Get all products from a manufacturer**
   - Use: ManufacturerIdIndex GSI
   - Query: `manufacturerId = ?`

4. **Get all vendors for a product (with pricing)**
   - Use: ProductIdIndex GSI on ProductVendors
   - Query: `productId = ?`

5. **Get all orders for a vendor**
   - Use: VendorIdIndex GSI
   - Query: `vendorId = ?`

6. **Get all order items in an order**
   - Use: OrderIdIndex GSI
   - Query: `orderId = ?`

7. **Get all receipts for an order item**
   - Use: OrderItemIdIndex GSI
   - Query: `orderItemId = ?`

## Cleanup Recommendations

### Safe to Delete (Obsolete Tables)

Run these commands to clean up unused tables:

```bash
# Delete underscore tables (old iteration)
aws dynamodb delete-table --table-name MaterialsSelection_Projects --region us-east-1
aws dynamodb delete-table --table-name MaterialsSelection_Categories --region us-east-1
aws dynamodb delete-table --table-name MaterialsSelection_LineItems --region us-east-1
aws dynamodb delete-table --table-name MaterialsSelection_Vendors --region us-east-1
aws dynamodb delete-table --table-name MaterialsSelection_Manufacturers --region us-east-1
aws dynamodb delete-table --table-name MaterialsSelection_Products --region us-east-1
```

**Cost Savings:** Deleting these unused tables will save on AWS DynamoDB storage costs.
